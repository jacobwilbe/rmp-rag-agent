He is the best computer science professor I have had. There is one homework a week and it is pretty easy. I am surprised with how structured this class was considering this was the first year they taught TypeScript. The final project was DIFFICULT. | Comment 2, Class CISC108: Although the class was quite easy, Bart is a very terrible professor. He is very condescending and gets annoyed at every little thing. | Comment 3, Class CISC181: I just really don't like him. The class is really boring, sorry, and he's honestly a bit insufferable. He acts condescending and makes you feel dumb for not understanding a new concept. He's previously had good reviews, but who knows, maybe he fell off.   | Comment 4, Class CISC108: I took this class as an intro class for CISC 108, and it honestly made my first semester so hard: There was way too much homework each week, and for this I would recommend going to the TA's as they really are the ones teaching this course too you, since Bart really does not teach at all. His lectures are pointless, but you must still go.  | Comment 5, Class CISC108: Online textbook for 108 is set up very well so if you stay on top of the assignments, you'll do well. It's easy to get a good grade if you get the assignments done early and give yourself time to ask any questions. Bart can come across rather condescending and passive aggressive when you ask him a question, as if he feels you should already know. | Comment 6, Class CISC108: Took Honors 108 - Easy class but could have learned everything online. Lectures and labs are useless but attendance to them is mandatory. Bart himself is arrogant and has a huge ego. Acts hostile to students who ask questions and expects us to know everything already. Also makes you use his awful python libraries he designed himself for some reason | Comment 7, Class CISC108: Dr. Bart made this class a very good introduction for people who don't really know anything about computer science. Very friendly and passionate about the content. Lectures are more focused on the collaborative/community aspects of CS rather than course content. Had condescending comments here or there but approachable overall. Super reachable too. | Comment 8, Class CISC108: The best way I can describe him is the kid in high school that got bullied and now takes his anger out on students. Very condescending and passive aggressive almost all the time. 108 is an entry level course, but he treats it like a postgraduate course. Not bad at teaching, but his attitude is terrible. | Comment 9, Class CISC108: Dr. Bart was a great professor! His lectures were easy to follow and there was plenty of practice for the concepts we learned on BlockPy (which he created). I already had programming experience before this class so it wasn't hard for me, but even if you are coming in with no experience, you'll do fine if you do the work and practice the concepts. | Comment 10, Class CISC108: Lectures and discussions were almost completely useless, most of the class it taught through the online textbook. I found the exams to be quite easy and Bart did seem to be very helpful when asked questions. The online textbook was a bit of helpful and homework was also very easy. | \", 'average_grade': 91.3, 'courses': {'CISC108', 'CISC181', 'CISC320', 'CISC374', 'CISC275'}}\n",

This year, I had him for CISC 275, and he was fantastic! I could tell that this was more of his area of expertise. He did a great job teaching Agile and had us do a fun project with React that incorporated Git and the ChatGPT API. | Comment 2, Class CISC275: CISC275 with Aromando is great. It's a great course in general. My only complaint was that the in class lectures seemed pointless at times. Also he is just a bit of a picky grader at times, but overall pretty easy to get an A if you try. | Comment 3, Class CISC275: I had John last year in CISC181, and I thought he was pretty good. I gave him a 4 out of 5.\\n\\nThis year he was even better and was made to teach this course. He did an amazing job of setting up the stages of the project development and made the course be much more like the real world. Amazing! 100% would take again! | Comment 4, Class CISC275: Aromando is the absolute GOAT. This is the first CISC class where I felt my work had real-world applications. Most of the learning you do is through applying your own knowledge and skills. He does an amazing job simulating the stages of product development. I would 100% take this class again. | Comment 5, Class CISC181: Professor Aromando was very good with his material when it comes to learning Java. He also is very good with answering questions you may have. He also sometime cracks jokes during lecture, making lecture worth it.\\n\\nThe only thing holding him back from being a 5/5 is his LACK OF A COSTCO CARD! | Comment 6, Class CISC106: Prof Aromando seemed like he wanted to do a lot more but was restricted by the curriculum. Lecture was kind of pointless and much of the actually learning comes from the assignments you do outside of class. If you understand how to code you'll do fine. Although there is no attendance, you do group assignments that are super annoying and pointless. | Comment 7, Class CISC106: CISC106 was stressful but fun at the same time. There were A LOT of coding assignments and 3 projects. If you allow yourself to learn and practice, coding in python will not be too difficult. Prof. Aromando was kind, but his lectures were pretty boring. Practicums/lectures are easy to follow for easy points. Apply yourself and you will do great! | Comment 8, Class CISC106: The class was a lot of work at times but if you understand it, it will come easy. I was able to understand it after working on comp sci but if you don't, it will be difficult. There is a lot of programming homework that you have to self-teach yourself, lectures have work that is mandatory that he goes over but does not relate a ton to the homework  | Comment 9, Class CISC106: comp sci was not a super easy course for me because you kind of have to teach yourself but john is very nice with helping students when needed. he also is very chill about extensions and cares about his students  | Comment 10, Class CISC106: Professor Aromando is very nice and understanding. If you follow the modules and do the lectures/practicum, you'll be fine. He's also very lenient with extensions, and the exams are super easy if you do the work. The exams also allow a cheat sheet and overall, the class is going well. | \", 'average_grade': 89.0, 'courses': {'CISC106', 'CISC181', 'CISC275'}}\n",

Exams are a little rough but he always goes over what is going to be on an exam. gives one a week assignments as grades/hw's. Responds to emails very fast and is always willing to help. Only negative is his lectures are a little boring. He re-reads the slides then explains it in depth. | Comment 2, Class CIS181: Very great and helpful professor! He increased my confidence in my abilities in computer science. He always helps and explains properly, understands the material very well, and explains it clearly. He even puts in effort to make his lectures interesting and participative for everyone. I would definitely recommend him, 100 percent. | Comment 3, Class CIS181: Silber is a great professor and probably the best in the cisc department. He is very laidback and cares a lot about his students. Even though the content of the class may be boring, Silber tries his best to make it engaging and funny. Only complaint I have is that it is kind of hard to reach him through email but he is great in person. | Comment 4, Class CIS181: For my class essentially being typescript guinnea pigs, this class was genuenly really fun. It renewed my faith in computer science after my middling experience with 108. Silber also made my actually enjoy web development, even though that wasnt even the main part of the course at all. Funny dude, felt like an uncle. Highly reccomend. | Comment 5, Class CIS181: He has set up classes in a way that helped me learn much easier than others. He is almost always available and has a cool uncle energy that makes him not only approachable but also very patient with any questions or concerns you have. | Comment 6, Class CISC260: It's not hard to see why a lot of students like Professor Silber. He's very knowledgeable with the content he teaches and is always willing to help students. That being said, I don't think he did the best job at structuring CISC 260. There were very few practice assignments to reinforce the concepts which made it a lot harder to understand them. | Comment 7, Class CISC260: He's nice but his exams are pretty bad. The assignments were easy but nothing like it was on the exam. | Comment 8, Class CISC260: Dr. Silber is awesome! He is pretty explicit about what to be prepared for on the exams and whatnot. Personally, I thought the class itself was kind of hard, but I managed to get an A because he rounded me up (I was off by 0.1%). He is also very accessible outside of class by appointment and office hours.  | Comment 9, Class CISC260: Silber is very knowledgeable of his stuff when it comes to assembly. He's very enthusiastic when it comes to these topics and it's quite evident. However, the midterm + final count for A LOT of the grade, so if you don't do well on them, you're in trouble. | Comment 10, Class CISC372: Silber is great! He is such a good guy, he really cares about his students and is always looking to help out. He is so passionate about the material. My only gripe is that his classes are very very lecture heavy. A tuesday/thursday 80 minutes of lecturing is extremely rough. I think he's a great lecturer, I just wish he could break it up a bit. | \", 'average_grade': 90.5, 'courses': {'CISC220', 'CISC210', 'CISC260', 'CSC360', 'CISC474', 'CISC361', 'CISC106', 'CIS361', 'CISC372', 'CISC475', 'CIS181', 'CISC303', 'CISC320', 'CIS470'}}\n",

Responds to emails late or doesn't respond at all. Grades exams, projects and other assignments very late till near the end of the semester. Exams were very tough and hard however the course is hard itself.  | Comment 2, Class CISC220: Yes, late grading was annoying and lectures are from slides, but she elaborates and does examples with polls that help a lot. ASK QUESTIONS!!. the projects aren't all that challenging, tracing on paper helps a lot with visualizing structures. paper tests help you retain the information, everyone learns differently. | Comment 3, Class CISC220: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROFESSOR IF POSSIBLE! One of the worst professors that taught a class, the learning material is vague, the tests are pretty hard and covers material we've never did, homework and projects never get graded on time even before the final, it's basically a leap of faith hoping that you teach yourself to pass the class. | Comment 4, Class CISC220: STAY AWAY if you can. Terrible teacher. She never grades on-time. She grades everything only after the final exam is over and classes are done for the semester. You will not have a clue about your grade standing until the classes are over. Bottom line is you are guaranteed to get AT LEAST one letter grade lower than your actual potential.     | Comment 5, Class CISC220: Why should we attend class if you're just going to read off the slides. Maybe solves a problem once every 2 weeks, pray your TAs are helpful or your foundational knowledge in C + individual study pays off. | Comment 6, Class CISC220: Hsu clearly knows her stuff but is not great at presenting the information. Lectures are boring and her slides are often not helpful when you need to teach yourself the material at home for worksheets or exams. The coding projects aren't super difficult but don't expect grades back from them until just days before the final exam. Exams are on paper | Comment 7, Class CISC220: She never grades anything and lectures are boring. There are literally like 5 actual coding assignments for this class and all you do is write functions for these data structures. You're not actually figuring out problems your just implementing things on the slides. You are better off teaching yourself and praying that ur tests pass. | Comment 8, Class CISC220: It's evident she knows her material and is open to answering any questions students have in and out of lecture. Grading is REALLY slow and (paper) exams are really difficult compared to in-class worksheets (we are allowed a 1-page front/back cheat sheet, however). She's nice, but not lenient towards extensions. Projects can be really difficult.  | Comment 9, Class CISC220: This professor consistently provides assignments with significant errors, and despite submitting them on time, she often corrects them belatedly due to falling asleep. | Comment 10, Class CISC220: Professor Hsu was overall knowledgable and passionate with the course and did a solid job of teaching it. I have to dock some points though because the TAs did a terrible job with grading in a timely manner. There were numerous assignments (some even going all the way back to September) that were not graded until after our final exam in December! | \", 'average_grade': 87.3, 'courses': {'CISC220'}}\n",

As a comp sci major this class made me more excited for the rest of the program. I personally found this class easy, and easy to pass, especially with the flexible due dates and instant feedback with blockPY. He is a joy to listen to and truly cares about his students and what he talks about. Also funny and joyful. | Comment 3, Class CISC304: Decker is wonderful. He provides amazingly simple, brief, and clear notes. That and the lectures is all you need to pass the course. Covers good, complex examples in lecture that always mirror the homework. DLV \"programming\" is something he needs more notes on, but otherwise this was a delightful course. | Comment 4, Class CISC304: The reason I like this professor so much is because he gives really hard homework, but his exams are actually fair. He always made sure to go over things more than once if half the class didn\\'t know what was going on and made sure to let us know exactly what to expect for exams. | Comment 5, Class CISC964: My deepest thanks to Professor Decker for his guidance, mentoring, and support. I never had an issue doing my classes, but when it comes to research, I became a coward and shut myself down. I am grateful that he did not give up on me and gives me this elevated pitch on my research, and literally helped me word by word. He is a great advisor! | Comment 6, Class CISC964: Absolutely love the brilliant ideas Professor Decker shares during our group meeting. One thing that I really appreciate is that he has a \"no question is bad question\" policy, he always explains the concept patiently and always maps it into something very visual. We love Decker! | Comment 7, Class CISC108: He explains things clear in class and he is a very nice guy. He is very helpful if you go to his office hours. Labs count a lot towards your grade so definitely do the labs. He has clicker questions but you will get participation grade no matter right or wrong. | Comment 8, Class CISC964: There are a thousand good words that I want to say to thank Professor Decker for his dedication to help me with my research. He always encourages me and helps me find the missing piece for my research. I admire how comprehensive his knowledge is, and wish I could learn from him the good sense to all the new trends in Multiagent systems applications | Comment 9, Class CISC964: He truly cares about his student, whenever I encounter a problem in my project, he always works with me, takes time to dig into the issue and helps me fix it. If it is an issue that cannot be fixed right away, he gives me a clear direction of where I should go. I wish I could do better since I am so fortunate to work with such a wonderful professor | Comment 10, Class CISC886: I fell in love with Multiagent Systems through this course. When I took it there was one homework  and two presentation assignments.

You are given a note sheet in exams to help you remember proofs and basic definitions. Attendance is mandatory since it is a chunk of your grade | Comment 3, Class CISC498: It's not easy to teach this class. There are about a hundred students and coordination with outside organizations, which must be nightmare. \\n\\nI really like how this class was designed, allowing for strong team building and selection of projects. The main problem is really just in how delayed the class is. The first 6-7 weeks are mostly empty. | Comment 4, Class CISC303: This was Keffer's first time teaching 303, and as a whole the class was pretty good. Homeworks/exams were very easy and matched up well with what we were taught. Class time could have been managed better; we spent far too much time in breakout rooms, and did not cover the whole curriculum, which kinda sucks because I liked his teaching style. | Comment 5, Class CISC303: Passionate professor, accessible via office hours. 70% of your grade is 4 homeworks that take forever to be graded, so you don't really know how you are doing until the end. Midterm/Final are pass fail. Lectures were held over zoom instead of in person, and were sometimes hard to follow followed by breakout rooms with a group that was  pointless.  | Comment 6, Class CISC498: He is a very nice guy. Any review for this specific class is not right. This class is actively changing and it is not really catered toward the professor of the class. You do your own work with your client without much involvement from the professor. On the other hand, whenever you need ANY help, he is readily available and very supportive.  | Comment 7, Class CISC498: For a senior design it's hard to say anything. He will help if you ask for it. If you do the work and your group members see it you'll get an A. First part of 498 drags on forever. | Comment 8, Class CISC481: Professor's lectures are largely confusing and feel like a waste of time. Constantly felt lost, and felt like the professor wasn't making sure everyone in the class was on the same page. The workload was goo. When you asked for help, Keffer gave great feedback and was helpful. Would be a better class if the lectures were not as confusing | Comment 9, Class CISC106: Keffer's a great choice! I'm not big on comp sci, and I was nervous that the class would be difficult. Labs open for a week, so you have plenty of time to ask for help from TAs or Keffer himself. Projects are completely dependent on the group you are in, good group  fun project! Keffer is super approachable, don't be afraid to ask questions! | Comment 10, Class CISC106: Great class. Never thought coding could possibly be interesting, but Professor Keffer made it so. Lectures were entertaining and was my best class during the remote semester. | \", 'average_grade': 90.5, 'courses': {'CISC303', 'CISC498', 'CISC106', 'CISC481'}}\n",

Roosen is a great professor who understands his students. I didn't really like how the course was online, but otherwise, I enjoyed the class. The final exam was also really easy. | Comment 2, Class CISC210: This professor gives very little instruction and doesn't grade any projects until the final two weeks of school. Hard grader, and a very unfair final policy. One of the least helpful teachers I have had in my life. Do not take him if you want to learn anything.  | Comment 3, Class CISC210: Roosen himself was a typical CS professor, he was very knowledgeable but could seem condescending at times. He isn't the worst in the department but he isn't very good. The class wasn't bad because everything was online but the projects were quite difficult. The grading is pretty relaxed as the final only counts for 5% of your grade. | Comment 4, Class CISC210: he often goes on long rants about weird topics in class. there are weekly timed quizzes that are really annoying. there are also a lot of readings for credit that are more annoying than helpful. he is a pretty nice guy tho and he sets his guidelines clearly early on. the discord is really helpful for when you're having trouble. | Comment 5, Class CISC210: I cannot do online classes, so take this with a grain of salt:\\nRoosen is a good dude, but god are his lectures really boring and filled with contribences. You will have to take 210 if you are CISC major, but avoid him otherwise. | Comment 6, Class CISC210: Roosen is very knowledgable however expects students to be more knowledgable than they are for this intro class. There's a lot of readings to do each week and the lectures teach the same things taught in the readings. The projects feel very out of nowhere and were much more difficult than expected and required more knowledge than we were taught. | Comment 7, Class CISC210: I thought this guy was an okay cisc professor until i actually had a bad cisc professor. This guy is mad chill and it is easy to get a good grade as long as you do the weekly assignments. The weekly assignments are pretty straight forward and helped my understanding tremendously. Don't listen to the bad reviews aroosen is the goat. | Comment 8, Class CISC210: This was a class that I thoroughly enjoyed. My biggest recommendations are that you start working on projects and assignments as early as possible and ask for help as needed to insure that you understand what everything is actually doing.  | Comment 9, Class CISC210: Professor Roosen overall was very knowledgeable and taught the course well, but he does have a little bit of a smug attitude that some may not like. I also was originally supposed to take this course in person, but some sections got switched around and I was moved to a virtual section. I probably would've preferred the course if it was in person. | Comment 10, Class CISC210: The class isn't bad topics-wise, and Roosen is a good lecturer. The class is just set up very poorly. Failing the final exam destroyed my grade, even after working hours and hours on the projects with A's on all of them. Perusall is horrible, no students should be subjected to it.

Definitely recommend it if you're into learning about the latest in computing. It's a whole different ballgame compared to your typical algorithms classes. | Comment 2, Class CISC303: He gives a super difficult homework but easy exams. If you actually understand what you do in homework you'll be fine on tests. Overall, great instructor. Learned a lot in this course. The quantum computing lecture was the best. The TA was helpful. | Comment 3, Class CISC303: The class is very difficult, one of the hardest in the CISC department. The exams are very difficult. Make sure you spend plenty of time studying for them. The homework assignments are very long. Make sure you start working on them ahead of time. Also, I think this professor needs clearer examples and slides and more transparency with grades. | Comment 4, Class CISC303: The 303 is by far the most challenging course among those that I took at UD. Safro is doing a very decent job in teaching it. Perhaps not too practical but you'll have an idea what the computers are and what they are able to solve. His homework is not easy but the grader was not harsh.  | Comment 5, Class CISC303: Not an easy course with a lot of homework. However, most of his tests are questions from homework, so having an A or B is not difficult if you work during the semester. It is also totally understandable that the theory of computer science is not something that everyone enjoys but he is definitely doing his best to explain it. | Comment 6, Class CISC303: Automata theory is no joke. It's a tough course, and you WILL have to work for this course and ask for help when you're confused. That being said, Dr. Safro was a great professor for this course. Everything was clearly explained with examples. Homeworks had some tough problems, nothing that would trash your grade though. Exam questions were fair. | Comment 7, Class CISC303: Participate, do whatever Dr. Safro says and everything will be fine. Yes, 303 is not a joke but his exams are taken from homework and slides, so just do your best during the semester. Perhaps the most knowledgeable instructor in the department. | Comment 8, Class CISC303: Prof. Safro is so knowledgeable and his passion makes the lectures interesting. Make sure to pay attention to lectures and homeworks and you will be well-prepared for the exams. Textbook is required and I barely used it, but was helpful when I used it. Attendance is not mandatory but the lectures fundamentally helped me understand the content.  | Comment 9, Class CISC303: Dr. Safro is very knowledgeable. The course is sometimes really fun but sometimes is somewhat boring if you don't enjoy theory.

He might be knowledgeable but can't teach it to save his life. So much necessary work. Long hw and you still have to watch 2.5h of prerecorded lectures outside of class cause the lecture is just class problems. plus quiz before each class. I basically bought myself everything and spend hours doing so much useless work | Comment 3, Class CISC372: Very lazy professor, he would upload lectures from 2 years ago that are roughly 45 min long of direct ppt. reading of which we would need to watch in order to answer 5 quiz questions before every class. In-class involved an hour 15 long period of coding questions which he does not explain or generally help with in any way. The HW is another level.  | Comment 4, Class CISC475: This might be both the toughest and least useful class I ever had. | Comment 5, Class CISC372: I don't know what these other reviews are about, but Siegel was awesome for Parallel Computing. Not too much homework, and all the projects and homeworks are fun and interesting. Guy really knows his stuff, and is very friendly and helpful during office hours. He really puts together a great course, and I learned a ton and enjoyed it. | Comment 6, Class CISC372: Dude sucks. He knows what he's doing but can't get the point across to save his life. Reads right from the slides and does insanely basic examples that don't correlate to the difficulty of the Homework Assignments at all. If you take Siegel, get ready to teach yourself cause he ain't a good parallel teacher. | Comment 7, Class CISC108: Lecture heavy, I wouldn't recommend skipping otherwise you may be lost looking at the notes.  Labs/Projects are challenging so be very careful who you choose as partners, they can make or break your grade. Exams are all written (no laptops) and you may bring a 8.5 x 11'' sheet of paper to the exams as a reference. | Comment 8, Class CISC108: Professor Siegel was honestly not  much help when it came to teaching Computer Science.

Assignments weren't difficult and labs and projects tended to be very short. There are group projects and the final project is mandatory group work. Tests are not difficult if you study topic sheets and do practice problems. | Comment 5, Class CISC106H: If you do your homework in this class then you will absolutely get an A. The hw is often frustrating and can be difficult and take some time, but if you do it yourself or even together with someone then the exams will be extremely easy for you. Projects are easy.

More depth on distributed systems would be valuable, as there was ample time. Frequent illnesses led to poor TA-led classes. An open project was unnecessary; a programming assignment would be more suitable. She sometimes appeared irritated with questions. | Comment 2, Class CISC361: Really easy class. If you participate and listen you will learn a lot. But I do agree that the lectures are boring. However she's really sweet extremely caring. There's easy extra credit. Exams are also easy. Final project also easy. The TA sucked which didn't help cause they grade everything. | Comment 3, Class CISC361: The lectures are very slow and boring, but you can see that she really tries. I can tell that she is very nice and cares a lot, but teaching just might not be her thing. The material is sort of easy, but this course really lacks application, of which she asks of you for a final coding project. I along with the whole class was very confused on this. | Comment 4, Class CISC663: Professor has a beautiful smile, she is very understanding and flexible and wants to help, but you need to ask. Course is very comprehensive, Hadoop and Spark are two most useful part for me. | Comment 5, Class CISC663: Expect to put a lot of effort on the course but you'll learn A LOT! You don't need the text book, she did not require it once. Class starts out easy, BUT gets tougher and she tends to quickly cover things. She has a sweet personality though. Project is tough, make sure you pair up with someone good. TA is good, helped a lot on HW assignments. | Comment 6, Class CISC663: Professor Lena's knowledge is remarkable. Very organized course and awesome lectures. | Comment 7, Class CISC361: Nice Professor, Professor is responsive, we needed more time on project and she extended it for us. Also had an awesome TA, she answered every single question from me, wish every TA were like her | Comment 8, Class CISC361: I've never written a review about a professor before and I'm only writing this because Lena is the worst professor I've ever had. She is a horribly boring lecturer and most of the material is easily learned through Google. The final project she assigns is outrageously difficult compared to the rest of the course material. Would never take again. | Comment 9, Class CISC361: I had a lot of fun taking Lena's class.  think she would make a great advisor. I was working on a research project and couldn't go past the math part  and reached out to her, she gave me a lot of useful advise. | Comment 10, Class CISC361: I took her OS course last fall. She is amazing! She is gentle and elegant, and she smiles sweetly and loves to help. Best thing of all she remembers everyone's name and is willing to reward you for your hard work. Very good professor, I will definitely recommend her! | \", 'average_grade': 93.0, 'courses': {'CISC663', 'CISC361'}}\n",

Gives great feedback and really helps with writing. Does one on one meetings with students in order to make sure each one gets in depth feedback on all papers. | Comment 4, Class CISC890: On new graduate student orientation, professor McCoy as our chair gave an inspirational speech to welcome everyone. She has the vision of a real scientist, and her speech connects to my heart. I feel that I could be someone that really use my research to change the world. I want to thank her for extending my funding, a great caring professor. | Comment 5, Class CISC882: Very good prof. Took 3 classes with her. Tends to give good grades if you give a decent effort. Some classes are focused very much around discussion instead of technical learning ... for better or worse. | Comment 6, Class CISC108: While she is a very kind person, who genuinely does want to help, half the the time she seems like she has no idea what she is doing or talking about. We spend a lot of class time watching her try to figure out how her computer works. She constantly second guesses herself which leaves everyone very confused. | Comment 7, Class CISC108: The class is basically based on the lab. Unfortunately the lectures sometimes don't cover lab material in time so you find yourself stuck sometimes. Office hours are going to have to be part of your schedule to pass. Oh, and it's a problem when a computer science professor doesn't know how to hook a laptop up to a projector. | Comment 8, Class CISC108: Just wants to help but was not very good at explaining herself. Her classes are behind the labs so you will show up to lab and just be sitting there clueless and the Lab TA's do not help at all. It's pretty bad because it could have been a great class if taught right. | Comment 9, Class CISC108: Very good professor who really wants to help her students understand computer science. If you are having trouble understanding the material by all means, go to office hours. She is extremely helpful and will help teach you through the labs explaining the concepts necessary to complete them. | Comment 10, Class CISC108: She is a very nice woman who definitely means well but most of the time she seems really confused. She spends too much class time going over old material and barely addresses new material that we need to know for labs. We didn't learn Java but were thrown into a java lab. i recommend taking another professor. | \", 'average_grade': 87.0, 'courses': {'CISC108', 'CISC280', 'CISC890', 'CISC882', 'CISC181', 'CISC181080', 'CISC681', 'CISC101', 'CISC180'}}\n",

He's always nice and patient when students ask questions. On the final presentation day, he even prepared snacks for us, which is very nice. The course materials are well organized and easy to follow. I would say it's a wonderful experience taking his course! | Comment 3, Class CISC684: Professor Peng's expectations are high and the material is complex. However, he is always available to answer questions after class and is accommodating for meetings outside of office hours. Be prepared to spend a significant amount of time on homework and researching the course material, especially if this is your first intensive ML class. | Comment 4, Class CISC684: The course lectures are up-to-date reflecting current ML practices and research. I had the opportunity to learn ML concepts ranging from beginner to advanced levels. This comprehensive content helps you build a solid foundation while progressively addressing more complex topics with hands-on homework assignments. | Comment 5, Class CISC684: I understood well in class. Learning with real life example was fun. He interacts as well in class and very nicely refreshes your previous lectures along the way. | Comment 6, Class CISC684: I would have liked the classes to have been clearer. While the homework was beneficial, it often felt disconnected from the material covered in class, requiring additional effort to complete. Clarity regarding the expectations for the final project would have been appreciated. | Comment 7, Class CISC684: I took his graduate ML class. Dr. Peng is very concerned that we should have a deep understanding of core machine learning concepts rather than regurgitate all the small details. As a graduate course, I also appreciated that Dr. Peng focused on relevant topics like GANs and meta-learning that are still receiving a lot of attention in ML research.  | Comment 8, Class CISC684: Most of his classes were going over slides that were prepared either by TA or some other professors. There were no exams at all and the final grade was based on just homework and the final project. The final project included presentation, reporting, and peer reviewing. Enjoyed the class with interesting topics but will not take this course again.  | \", 'average_grade': 93.0, 'courses': {'CISC684'}}\n",

I was too timid to say it in person. I want to thank her for encouraging me to graduate program. When I was totally lost she sat down with me and encouraged me and told me that I was on the right track. For this I am forever grateful. | Comment 4, Class CISC672: You will never finish your project: building a compiler called \"MeggyJava\". Its not because is it hard. Its because there is no class diagrams, no easy-to-start code, no IDE for debug and no explicit hint for this compiler. All you can rely on is google resource. If you want to balance all your courses, STAY AWAY FROM CISC672. | Comment 5, Class CISC471: New semester long project assigned (Building a compiler) and it\\'s hell. It\\'s unclear, the due dates are set too early, even so only extended a few more days. Unreasonable amount of work on top of the intensely long set of projects. Expect to spend 10+h coding on this class per week on top of other stuff. | Comment 6, Class CISC672: The class is good and the professor tries to make it amenable and useful.  If you are not good at coding, then it is likely you\\'ll suffer. Also, You need to read from the book to complement the lectures. When picking a partner for the project make sure you select someone not lazy at coding, you really need a competent partner.   | Comment 7, Class CISC372: The worst instructor ever, and forever. | Comment 8, Class CISC106: She was extremely unclear in her assignments due dates. She isn\\'t stupid but she is way too smart for an intro level class. Unless you\\'ve done coding before and are talented in coding i wouldnt recommend it. | Comment 9, Class CISC106H: First time teaching 106, she did a fairly good job at it. 106 is mandatory for engineering majors, and is intro level, lots of people in the class new to computer science, large portion of the class absolutely hates it and are pretty terrible at it Tests are dead easy if you actually did the labs instead of asking people for their code.

Will always help you if you have problems with anything. Explains everything very clearly. People complaining about him just don't put in the work It's not an easy A but if you just pay attention and do the work it will be easy A | Comment 2, Class CISC360: Sethi is a very good prof. He does a good job in teaching and practicing the material, but the beginning of the class might have been a little bit weed-out. I get many mixed signals on whether I should give him a good or bad rating, but overall I feel like I learned a lot and he truly is a caring person about your grades and your learning.  | Comment 3, Class CISC450: Explains everything very well and doesn't just read of the slides  The lab was really easy you should get an ez 100 on that Homework is also easy if you r paying attention and he posts his annotated slides which helps exams need more effort but he curves | Comment 4, Class CISC360: If you read textbooks religiously you should be fine. But otherwise you have a very low chance to pass. | Comment 5, Class CISC360: Apparently he is good in other classes. But for 360 he really only explains the surface level with generic examples. Then he proceeds to give us problems that require a very in depth knowledge of the subject and that he has not gone over an example similar to it. | Comment 6, Class CISC360: Reading off slides, no projects or anything else really makes course boring. | Comment 7, Class CISC360: Sethi is more concerned about someone possibly cheating than being a good instructor. He will not share solutions to problems, and will give very vague ideas of what you should do only if pressed. Obviously, he values rote memorization over actual learning, and really put a substandard course together for 360. Very disappointing. | Comment 8, Class CISC450: Great guy. he has super detailed lectures and is always willing to go back and explain things. One of the most universally liked professors ive had so far. There's an in-class assignment at least once a week that counts for a good chunk your grade so definitely GO TO CLASS. Its an interesting subject so the 75 minutes goes by quick | Comment 9, Class CISC450: Professor Sethi is the Networks master, hands down. Every single one of his lectures is well detailed so that you won't be lost with the topics. He also has his notes well organized so when you have to study for an exam, you won't be lost when looking for information. Assignments are tough, but written with great detail so you don't get lost. | Comment 10, Class CISC450: Sethi is THE professor to take networks with. He knows his stuff, and goes over everything twice to clear up any confusion. ATTEND CLASS, even through he puts the lectures up, he adds a lot of info during class that you cant get from the slides.

He speaks softly and unclearly. While the course structure is well-designed, quizzes and homework sometimes cover unmentioned explanations. Homework often rambles, and a cheatsheet would be helpful. Timely homework and LaTeX slides would improve the experience. | Comment 2, Class CISC488: He makes exams hard, and he grades tough; the TA graded generously, and he asked you to spend 18 dollars on a useless poster; he asks for final projects, and he has two exams, as well as final reports. his accent is hard to understand. do not take any class with him, he only cares his phd students.  | Comment 3, Class CISC303: Vijay is an amazing teacher.  If you don't understand something, he really wants to know, so he can go over it again in class.  His homeworks are extremely reflective of the tests and not difficult if you pay attention in class.  Textbook is optional, but a nice supplement. | Comment 4, Class CISC484: As others have said, not at all respectful when you go to his office hours for help or email. Even if you understand the material well he's still not nice. Grading expectations aren't always clear for assignments. | Comment 5, Class CISC304: This class was pretty easy for me, but it was still interesting. Exams were similar to homework problems, grading was fair. Posted PDFs of his notes onto Canvas. If you have a hard time hearing usually, be prepared to show up to this course a few minutes early. He's not the loudest/clearest speaker. | Comment 6, Class CISC304: very easy class. Speaks a lot which doesn't make sense, but once he does examples, it's pretty simple. Not much homework. He tells you exactly what will be on the exams, which are veeery similar to the homework. Not very clear when answering your questions, but ehhh you shouldnt have too many. | Comment 7, Class CISC601: Not that good but ok | Comment 8, Class CISC404: Garbage teacher. Chalk and board only, no slides which would be okay if he didn't erase and replace what he's writing (which makes it hard to take notes). Examples of concepts are usually poorly done or not done at all. | Comment 9, Class CISC404: Difficult material made easier by Vijay's clear teaching style.

The projects have varied difficulty and length so read over each one before deciding how to divide you time for it. She is slow to respond to emails though. | Comment 2, Class CISC220: Good teacher & nice person, her powerpoints are very detailed and laid out well. Her projects are long and sometimes difficult, but start them early and you'll do OK. My biggest gripe about her class is organization, she doesn't seem to reply to emails, and grading takes literal months. Overall her class was alright, but take note of those things. | Comment 3, Class CISC220: With complete peace and love, the pure sloppiness of this class was astounding. You're graded based on three major things; Projects, Exams/Quizzes, and Participation. She doesn't teach in class, and the videos she gives aren't clear on anything except time complexities. The projects are very hard, and she's nearly impossible to get ahold of.  | Comment 4, Class CISC220: Professor Yarrington is a very nice individual, that being said the class was very hard in my opinion. You need to do well on the projects and exams to do well in the class. If you do not do well on either one you will not pass the class. Her lectures are not helpful because you have to watch her online videos because she does not teach in class. | Comment 5, Class CISC220: Professor Yarrington is an amazing professor, she comes buy to help you with projects during class but also cares that her students are passing the class. The one thing that is concerning is that she does not reply to emails in a timely manner.

There is one homework a week and it is pretty easy. I am surprised with how structured this class was considering this was the first year they taught TypeScript. The final project was DIFFICULT. | Comment 2, Class CISC108: Although the class was quite easy, Bart is a very terrible professor. He is very condescending and gets annoyed at every little thing. | Comment 3, Class CISC181: I just really don't like him. The class is really boring, sorry, and he's honestly a bit insufferable. He acts condescending and makes you feel dumb for not understanding a new concept. He's previously had good reviews, but who knows, maybe he fell off.   | Comment 4, Class CISC108: I took this class as an intro class for CISC 108, and it honestly made my first semester so hard: There was way too much homework each week, and for this I would recommend going to the TA's as they really are the ones teaching this course too you, since Bart really does not teach at all. His lectures are pointless, but you must still go.  | Comment 5, Class CISC108: Online textbook for 108 is set up very well so if you stay on top of the assignments, you'll do well. It's easy to get a good grade if you get the assignments done early and give yourself time to ask any questions. Bart can come across rather condescending and passive aggressive when you ask him a question, as if he feels you should already know. | Comment 6, Class CISC108: Took Honors 108 - Easy class but could have learned everything online. Lectures and labs are useless but attendance to them is mandatory. Bart himself is arrogant and has a huge ego. Acts hostile to students who ask questions and expects us to know everything already. Also makes you use his awful python libraries he designed himself for some reason | Comment 7, Class CISC108: Dr. Bart made this class a very good introduction for people who don't really know anything about computer science. Very friendly and passionate about the content. Lectures are more focused on the collaborative/community aspects of CS rather than course content. Had condescending comments here or there but approachable overall. Super reachable too. | Comment 8, Class CISC108: The best way I can describe him is the kid in high school that got bullied and now takes his anger out on students. Very condescending and passive aggressive almost all the time. 108 is an entry level course, but he treats it like a postgraduate course. Not bad at teaching, but his attitude is terrible. | Comment 9, Class CISC108: Dr. Bart was a great professor! His lectures were easy to follow and there was plenty of practice for the concepts we learned on BlockPy (which he created). I already had programming experience before this class so it wasn't hard for me, but even if you are coming in with no experience, you'll do fine if you do the work and practice the concepts. | Comment 10, Class CISC108: Lectures and discussions were almost completely useless, most of the class it taught through the online textbook. I found the exams to be quite easy and Bart did seem to be very helpful when asked questions. The online textbook was a bit of helpful and homework was also very easy. | \",\n",
